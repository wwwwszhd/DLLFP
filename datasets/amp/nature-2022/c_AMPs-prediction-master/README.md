# c_AMPs-prediction
Prediction of new c_AMPs, from the prediction of sORF to the getting c_AMPs. [Scripts](https://github.com/mayuefine/c_AMPs-prediction/blob/master/c_AMPs-Prediction.md "c_AMPs-Prediction.md").<br>
Trained predictive model.[Models](https://github.com/mayuefine/c_AMPs-prediction/tree/master/Models).<br>
Test set data under 50AA in length, and also the benchmark dataset.[Dataset](https://github.com/mayuefine/c_AMPs-prediction/tree/master/Data).<br>
<br>
Verified AMPs have been deposited and published in [ADP database](https://aps.unmc.edu/).<br>
For sequences that have been predicted but not yet verified, please contact **Jun Wang**(junwang\@im.ac.cn) and request a **Material Transfer Agreement (MTA)** to ensure proper usage.<br>
